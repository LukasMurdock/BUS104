// Initialize variables 
var productCode="",
    quantity=1,
    priceTotal=0,
    volumeTotal=0,
    itemTotal=0;
    

// In this example each array acts as a 'column' of the table.
var codeArray =   ["LT", "ST", "DC", "LC", "PR", "SP", "SW"];
var volumeArray = [5, 3, 3.75, 2, 2.5, 0.5, 0.5];
var priceArray =   [900, 600, 675, 700, 325, 800, 500];

/*
Another way to mentally view arrays would be like lists starting at 0:
codeArray =       volumeArray =     priceArray =
0.) LT            0.) 5             0.) 900
1.) ST            1.) 3             1.) 600
2.) DC            2.) 3.75          2.) 675
3.) LC            3.) 2             3.) 700

So the process of this program is
1. Getting the product code ("LT") and quantity from the user,
2. Searching the 'codeArray' to find the location of that product, in this case 'LT' = 0.
    It's the first item and arrays start at 0.
3. Now that we have the location of that item we can search the other 'lists' (arrays) at that same location!
    From this we can find the volume of that product and the price,
    We're really asking the computer, "hey what's the value of #0 in volumeArray?"
     and "What's the value of #0 in priceArray?"
    item 0 (the location of 'LT') in volumeArray = 5
    item 0 in priceArray = 900
4. So everytime we get input from the user ^this^ entire thing plays out.
    To get totals across all products we enter we just add the same variable to its calculation,
    priceTotal = priceTotal +
    volumeTotal = volumeTotal + 
    itemTotal = itemTotal +
5. So now that we know where the price and volume for the product is... it's time to calculate.
    To calculate the total price for the products we need to include quantity of products,
    priceTotal = priceTotal + (priceArray[0] * quantity)
    ^ remember we add it to itself because we want the total across ALL the entered products, and this loop plays out multiple times.
6. Output that shit so we know we did it right!
    Hopefully this helped and didn't just confuse the shit out of you.
    That was a lot of words but it's really not that much code.
